    <h1>Dishcoverr Privacy Policy</h1>
</div>


<!-- Welcome -->
<div class="section-container">
    <div class=" text-center">
        <h2>Thank you for using Dishcoverr!</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Our mission is the help you discover and share great food with your friends and the world.</p>

    <p>To do that, we help you get connected to friends you know and any food lovers we think you'll be interested in based on information we collect from you and third parties.</p>

    <p>We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it. </p>
</div>

<!-- How we collect information -->
<div class="section-container">
    <div class=" text-center">
        <h2>We collect information in a few different ways</h2>
    </div>

    <h3>1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it</h3>

    <p>When you sign up for or use Dishcoverr, you give us certain information voluntarily. This includes your name, email address, birthday, profile photo, your favirote kind of food, and any other information you give us. </p>
    
    <p></p>

    <p>If you link your Facebook account or accounts from other third party services to Dishcoverr, we also get information from those accounts (such as your friends, name, email address, birthday, profile photo).</p>

    <p>The information we get from those services depends on your settings and their privacy policies, so please check what those are.</p>

    <h3>2. We also get technical information when you use Dishcoverr</h3>

    <p>Whenever you use any website, mobile application or other internet service, certain information gets created and logged automatically. The same is true when you use Dishcoverr. Here are some of the types of information we collect:</p>

    <p><b>Log data</b>. When you use Dishcoverr, our servers record information (“log data”), including information that your mobile app automatically sends when you’re using it. This log data includes your settings, searches, the date and time of your request, how you used Dishcoverr, and device data.</p>

    <p><b>Device information</b>. In addition to log data, we collect information about the device you’re using Dishcoverr on, including type of device, operating system, settings, unique device identifiers and crash data that helps us understand when something breaks. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using an iPhone or Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</p>

<!-- What we do with user's information -->
<div class="section-container">
    <div class=" text-center">
        <h2>What we do with the info we collect</h2>
    </div>

    <p>We use the information we collect to provide the Service to you. We commit to showing you content that’s relevant, interesting and personal to you. In order to do that, it’s necessary for us to use your information to: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Identify you when you use Dishcoverr, and process your transactions.</li>
      <li>Recommend dishes, restaurants, other people, and food moments from other people you might like based on your activity on Dishcoverr. For example, if we see you’re into healthy food, we may suggest healthy-food-related dishes, people or food moments that we think you might like.</li>
      <li>Respond to your questions or comments.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition and for similar reasons, we have a legitimate interest in using your information in these ways. It is also fundamental to the nature of the Service we provide. In short, it’s necessary for us to do these things in order to make the Service relevant, interesting and personal to you like we promised, and it’s in both of our interests for us to do that.</p>

    <p>We also have a legitimate interest to improve Dishcoverr, maintain our relationship with you, and protect users. We both benefit when we use your information to: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Suggest other people who have similar food interests.</li>
      <li>Help your friends and contacts find you on Dishcoverr, if you agree to this in your settings. For example, if you sign up using a Facebook account, we can help your Facebook friends find you on Dishcoverr when they first sign up for Dishcoverr. Or, people can search for your account on Dishcoverr using your name or email.</li>
      <li>Conduct analytics on who is using Dishcoverr and what they are doing. For example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature on Dishcoverr, we can understand which version is better.</li>
      <li>Improve Dishcoverr and offer new features.</li>
      <li>Send you updates (such as when certain activity, like saves or comments, happens on Dishcoverr) and news by email or push notification, depending on your settings. For example, we send notifications that when people comment on your food moment. You can decide to stop getting these notifications by updating your settings .</li>
    </ul>
